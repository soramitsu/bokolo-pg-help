# Adding a new bank

A new bank is added by the central bank through their **Core** service. Once a new bank has been added to the **Bokolo** network, it must be activated by its three **Keyholder** users.

**Keyholder** users are created by the central bank at the time of registering a new bank in the **Bokolo** network. Their login credentials are provided privately to the email addresses that the keyholders had submitted in advance.

Once all the **Keyholder** users are in possession of their login credentials, they may proceed to [Activating a new bank](./activate-bank.md).
