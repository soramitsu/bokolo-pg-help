# Creating new users

::: info

To learn about default user roles and permissions, see [Roles and Permissions](../roles.md).

By default, a newly activated bank in the Bokolo network has a single user—`access_manager`—**Access Manager**.

The **Access Manager** user is able to create new users, assign them roles, create new custom roles and grant specific permissions to roles.

To create a new user, an **Access Manager** must perform the following steps:
1. Open a browser and go to your bank's personal Payment Gateway address that has been provided by the central bank during registration.
2. Log in using the `username` and `password` credentials provided by the central bank during registration.\
   The **Users** screen appears.

   ::: tip Note

   By default, **Access Manager**'s credentials are as follows:

   - **Username**: `access_manager`;
   - **Password**: is sent to the email address specified during the bank registration process.

3. On the **Users** screen, select **Add user**.\  
   The **New User** screen appears.

   - **Last name**: the user’s real last name.
   - **Email**: the user’s email address that will receive an email with a temporary password.

   ::: tip Note

   The email address must be real. A temporary password will be sent to the specified email address.

A **Success** notification appears and a new entry appears in the **Users** table on the **Users** screen.
