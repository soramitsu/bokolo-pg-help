# Activating a new bank

In the **Bokolo** network, to activate a new bank, all three **Keyholder** users must individually perform the following steps:
1. Open a browser and go to your bank's **Payment Gateway** address provided to you by the central bank during registration.
2. Log in using your `username` and `password` credentials provided to you by the central bank during registration.\
   The **Register account** screen appears.
3. Come up with a *unique secret key* and input it into the **Secret key** and **Repeat secret key** fields, then click **Submit**.

::: tip Note

The secret key must contain at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one numeric character and one special character.

## Backing up secret key

If you—as a **Keyholder**—decide that you would like to back up your secret key in case of a possible server migration in the future, click **Backup** on the **Backup secret key** screen that appears after the secret key is submitted.

Backed up secret keys are encrypted and a file containing the key is automatically downloaded to your device’s default **Downloads** folder. (e.g., `C:\\Users\\<username>\\Downloads` on Microsoft Windows 7 or above).

## Finalizing activation

Once all of the three **Keyholders** have successfully input their secret keys, the bank is activated, and now it is possible to create users that execute various internal operations of the bank by means of Bokolo Payment Gateway.

For information on how to create new users, see [Creating new users](./create-users.md).
