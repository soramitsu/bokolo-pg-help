# Dashboard

Use the **Dashboard** tab to have a quick and easy access to the [Main Account](./main-account.md), [Incoming Transactions](./incoming-trx.md) and [Outgoing Transactions](./outgoing-trx.md) screens on a single tab.

## Accessibility

By default, this tab is only accessible by users with the [Manager](../roles.md#manager) role.

## On this tab

The **Dashboard** consists of the following three panels:
1. **Total Balance** — duplicates the data from the [Main Account](./main-account.md) screen.
2. **Incoming Transactions** — duplicates the data from the [Incoming Transactions](./incoming-trx.md) screen.
3. **Outgoing Transactions** — duplicates the data from the [Outgoing Transactions](./outgoing-trx.md) screen.
